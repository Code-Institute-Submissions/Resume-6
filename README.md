# My Resume

Milestone Project - 1 - My Resume

I have developed this page to provide a resume for employers. I choose to create this as a single page website with four sections.

The page has been designed to exhibit my skills in HTML and CSS that I have learnt so far on my Full Stack Web Development course with The Code Institute. 

Links below to my GitHub Pages and Github Repository:

# UX
This website has been designed to act as an online resume in the future when I am in a position to look for work as a Web Developer. It has been created showing my skills 
in HTML and CSS so far.

# User Stories
Who would use the page and why, how effective is it.

# Features
- **Home** - The background picture is a high-res coding image, overlayed with a portrait of myself introducing my name and future proffesion to potential employers 
at the first glance. 
- **About** - This section reinforces who I am, and informs the user that I am a student with Code Institute, providing contact information and displaying a bar 
chart to represent my skills (these may not be 100% accurate at the moment but will be amended as the course progresses.)
- **Work** - An overview of what I have currently achieved and my career goals for the future. 
- **Hobbies** - To make the resume more personal, I have added a section dedicated for the employer to get to know me better as a person. This displays three of my
main hobbies, all of which show my commitment and persiverance.
- **Contact** - I have added a contact form to the bottom section of the page for anyone to get in touch with me.
- **Footer** - Repeats my name and links to social media.

# Deployment and Demo 
The project is hosted on GitHub Pages

The process involved:

- Host a git repository on GitHub.
- Create project in GitPod saving each big change for version control to GitHub.
- Open your project repository in GitHub.
- Click on settings.
- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
- Click on source and select master branch.
- After the page refreshes you will have a link to your deployed website.
- Final product now hosted on GitHub Pages.

To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the repository
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
- Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser
- Visit the link provided
- Your website with any made changes will appear

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.
It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.
During development the site is written in VS Code. It is run using Live Server plugin for VS Code.
